## 🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates a smart door lock system built for IT BSc degree demonstration. The system addresses a real-world problem in Finnish apartment buildings and enables remote door control through multiple communication channels including WiFi, ESP-NOW, and AWS IoT Cloud services.

## 🏢 Problem Statement

### Current Issue in Finnish Apartment Buildings

In Finland, apartment buildings typically have a two-tier door system:

1. **Main Building Door**: Often automated with digital access codes or key fobs
2. **Individual Unit Doors**: Traditional mechanical locks requiring physical keys

This creates several challenges for residents:

- **Service Access**: Couriers, food delivery personnel, and cleaning services cannot enter individual units when residents are away
- **Family Access**: Children or elderly family members may lose keys or forget them
- **Emergency Situations**: Family members, caregivers, or emergency contacts cannot access the unit remotely
- **Guest Access**: Visitors require physical key handover, which is inconvenient for short-term stays
- **Security Concerns**: Spare keys hidden outside pose security risks

### Our Solution

Our smart door lock system specifically targets **individual apartment unit doors**, providing:

✅ **Remote Access Control**: Grant access to delivery personnel, family members, or guests without physical keys  
✅ **Temporary Permissions**: Set time-limited access for specific services or visitors  
✅ **Real-time Monitoring**: Know when your door is accessed and by whom  
✅ **Emergency Access**: Family members can unlock the door remotely in emergencies  
✅ **No Infrastructure Changes**: Works with existing apartment door systems  

This solution bridges the gap between the convenience of automated building entrances and the security needs of individual apartment units.

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Real-World Scenarios

1. **Food Delivery** 🍕
   - Grant 15-minute access to delivery person
   - Monitor delivery completion remotely

   - Remote monitoring of care visits
   - Emergency access for medical situations

4. **Cleaning Services** 🧹
   - Weekly scheduled access for cleaning personnel
   - Verify service completion
   - Temporary access without key duplication

5. **Emergency Situations** 🚨
   - Remote access for family during emergencies
   - Landlord access for maintenance issues
   - Guest access when resident is traveling
